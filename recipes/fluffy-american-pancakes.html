    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        Light and fluffy american-style pancakes, perfect for breakfast or brunch!
    </p>
    <p>
        Serves 4
    </p>
        
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>135g plain flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp caster sugar</li>
        <li>130ml milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tbsp melted butter (allow to cool slightly), plus extra for cooking</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>To serve</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>butter</li>
        <li>maple syrup</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sift the flour, baking powder, salt and caster sugar into a large bowl.
            In a separate bowl or jug, lightly whisk together the milk and egg, then
            whisk in the melted butter.</li>
        <li>Pour the milk mixture into the flour mixture and, using a fork, beat until
            you have a smooth batter. Any lumps will soon disappear with a little mixing.
            Let the batter stand for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick frying pan over a medium heat and add a knob of butter. When
            it's melted, add a ladle of batter (or two if your frying pan is big enough to
            cook two pancakes at the same time). It will seem very thick but this is how it
            should be. Wait until the top of the pancake begins to bubble, then turn it
            over and cook until both sides are golden brown and the pancake has risen to
            about 1cm/Â½in thick.</li>
        <li>Repeat until all the batter is used up. You can keep the pancakes warm in a
            low oven, but they taste best fresh out the pan.</li>
        <li>Serve with lashings of real maple syrup and extra butter, if you like.</li>
    </ol>
