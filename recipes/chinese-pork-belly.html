    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>900g pork belly</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Chinese rice wine</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tbsp Chinese five spice</li>
        <li>2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp white pepper</li>
        <li>2 tbsp rice vinegar</li>
        <li>160g rock salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>To serve</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>sugar, for dipping</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The night before you want to cook, pierce the pork skin all over with a corn 
            cob spike or sharp knife, taking care not to puncture the meat underneath. If
             using a knife, be sure not to cut too deeply. The more holes you can pierce 
             into the skin, the crisper the skin will be. Lay the pork belly skin side-down
              and massage the rice wine into the meat side only, followed by the five spice,
               salt and pepper. Now place the pork belly in a dish skin side-up, dry the 
               skin with kitchen paper and place in the fridge, uncovered, overnight.</li>            
        <li>When you’re ready to cook, preheat the oven to 180°C.</li>
        <li>Place the pork on a piece of foil, fold the edges up to the pork belly, covering
             the meat, but not the skin, on all sides. Dry the skin with kitchen paper again
              and then brush with rice vinegar. Cover the skin completely with rock salt, 
              then transfer to the oven to cook for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Remove the salt crust from the pork belly and transfer it to a clean baking tray.
             Return to the oven, uncovered, for 30–40 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and place under a hot grill for a further 8–10 minutes 
            until super-crispy but not burnt.</li>
        <li>Cut into slices and serve with a bowl of sugar for dipping.</li>
    </ol>
