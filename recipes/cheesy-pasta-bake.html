    <h3>To serve</h3>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 190Â°C.</li>            
        <li>Boil a large pan of water and cook the pasta for 1 minute less than recommended
             on the pack, then drain.</li>
        <li>Whilst the pasta is cooking, heat the oil on a medium heat, in a large frying 
            pan. Add the chicken, and cook until just sealed - about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the onion and cook for a further 3-4 minutes until the onion is softened.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped peppers, salt, pepper, garlic, tomato puree, oregano and thyme.
             Stir and cook for 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tinned tomatoes and cream, bring to a gentle bubble, then add the 
            pasta, spinach and cooked bacon. Stir everything together, then transfer to a 
            large baking dish.</li>
        <li>Top with the cheddar and mozzarella, and place in the oven for 20-25 minutes,
             until the cheese is golden brown.</li>
        <li>Take out of the oven and top with parsley before serving.</li>
    </ol>
